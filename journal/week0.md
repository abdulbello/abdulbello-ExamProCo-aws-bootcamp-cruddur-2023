# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

I created an AWS account for the bootcamp as my current previous account was over one year and i wanted to leverage the 12 month free tier you get with a new account. I also watched the Youtube videos from Chirag and Ashish.

One of my first tasks after creating this account was to obviously login to the root account and created an IAM user. I then assigned the IAM user admin provileges to enable me administer my the AWS account without the root account. Just before logging out of the root account, i had to "activate" access to billing information for the root account.


Protection for root account (MFA and maybe credential destruction)

I then proceeded to log in as the new IAM user and created a billing alarm using Cloudwatch. While creating the alarm, i had to create an SNS topic to be used in delivering CloudWatch Notifications to my email via SNS.

I also created a budget of $5, and a notification setting that'll be triggerred if my actual usage is close to and hits the budgetted amount.


I then created the required conceptual and logical architectural diagram for cruddur and the logical CI/CD pipeline architecture for it.
