# Week 4 â€” Postgres and RDS

Yay!! its RDS week. I've been looking forward to this week and next week (Dynamo DB), because i've not really had much experience with designing amd working with DB in-depth other than writing a few SQL queries.


Just finished watching the recording of the lifestream and its been interesting so far.. I wouldnt say too complex because we've mostly been copying and pasting code. I do like that Andrew found a way to include bash scripting in there. What we have learnt so far, i'm sure would be really useful going forward. In my recent interview with a company, i was asked some questions around bash scripting that i coudln't answer, so i'm glad we are learning some of it here.
