# Week 2 â€” Distributed Tracing

Its week 3!!, its exciting and the work continues!!!


So this week, we would be working on distributed tracing. Which is a way to implement observability into your project. Distributed tracing enables us view telemetry (metrics, logs and traces) data across all our services (backend, frontend).


While instrumenting our app to send telemetry to Honeycomb, we encountered the Pip dependency management issue.- where pip does not auto-update the requirements.txt file with packages installed with the "pip" command. I decided to read up on the issue and discovered the new way of handling dependencies for python is with Pipenv. It handles the pip dependency issue quite well and additionally helps create a virtual environment. Pipenv creates a pipfile and pipfile.lock file where it stores packages (dependencies) and their version numbers automatically in the pipfile.lock file. This helps reduce potential application crash issues when the project is installed on a different machine or when the pipenv install --deploy command is run. The pipenv install --deploy command is what helps install the exact dependencies specified in the pipfile and pipfile.lock files.

I have decided to move to Pipenv for dependency management on this project. I had to modify my backend-app Dockerfiles to reflect these changes.
