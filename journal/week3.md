# Week 3 â€” Decentralized Authentication

Hello!!!

Finally got a chance to catch up on the bootcamp.. I'm about two weeks behind schedule as i had to work on my Master's thesis concurrently.


Anyway, i've created my cognito user pool and looking forward to using it.. I have always wondered how it works especially when i was preparing for the AWS SOlutions Architect certification.

We configured the user pool without setting it to generate a client app secret. I wonder if thats good security. We'll see.


During the Cognito custom pages exercise, i made some changes outside Andrew's instructions. I allowed users to either login with email/username (i think it gives more flexibility). All i had to do was pass username as username in the signup page mappings. I also changed the label on the confirmation page to say the user can verify their email by providing username/email info. I don't see this as a security issue since the user still has to provide the code sent to their email.

As part of the strectch exercises, i need to ensure the user signup confirmation code, resend feature works.


I'm currently watching the video for the cognito jwt server side verifier and it took way more time than i thought. A good knowledge to have is how to architect a software i.e Structure a software to know where to put classes, how to make them communicate and interoperate. I'll find some time to learn this. But yeah, there is a lot of information being learnt here and it really makes me appreciate Andrew and his entire team.

Watching the jwt video helped me get a better idea of how cors work, pre-processing a request, and structuring your application to separate libraries from services.
