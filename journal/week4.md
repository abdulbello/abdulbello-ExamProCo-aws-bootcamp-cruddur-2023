# Week 4 â€” Postgres and RDS

Yay!! its RDS week. I've been looking forward to this week and next week (Dynamo DB), because i've not really had much experience with designing amd working with DB in-depth other than writing a few SQL queries.


Just finished watching the recording of the lifestream and its been interesting so far.. I wouldnt say too complex because we've mostly been copying and pasting code. I do like that Andrew found a way to include bash scripting in there. What we have learnt so far, i'm sure would be really useful going forward. In my recent interview with a company, i was asked some questions around bash scripting that i coudln't answer, so i'm glad we are learning some of it here.






Below is proof of instructional video completion

Wow!! Its been an engaging week. I just finished the creating activities Youtube Stream where we connected our app to the RDS instance we created to store and query data from it. We also wrote the code to enable users create activities and for the app to load the home page with posts from the DB. It was quite intense and i feel like i need to go back to internalize how we've gone about writing the code.


I learnt what i would call "a new pattern of writing code" where we write from scratch our own ORM to give us flexibility and the option to extend it if need be. Although it means writing more code and by extension, additional time spent, its a good learning experience. I also researched and found out am ORM that i can use for personal flask projects, SQLAlchemy. I am still reading about it and i hope to use it soon as well and compare what we have to what SQLAlchemy has to offer. 

I am also getting inspired to use this project as a template for an app i would like to write for my current employer. Hopefully i'm able to get to it soon enough.

I look forward to next week's dynamo db class.
